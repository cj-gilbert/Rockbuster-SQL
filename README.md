# Rockbuster-SQL
### SUMMARY: 
A demo project using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to clean, document, query, and analyze data from a fictitious movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth.

### OBJECTIVES

• Load and clean data. 

• Document the relationships between tables, columns, and keys in a data dictionary and an entity relationship diagram.

• Query the database to answer questions from marketing and sales teams. 

• Highlight key results to executive team as well as document all work for the rest of the data department.


### DATA
Fictitious data downloaded from: 
http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip 


### TOOLS
*Language:* PostgreSQL

*Software:* pgAdmin, DbVisualizer, Tableau, Excel

### SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
•	**Cleaning data:** checked and addressed duplicates, non-uniform data, and missing values. 

•	**Joining tables:** selected the type of joins and sequence of joins in order to minimize the time/memory needed.


•	**Writing queries:**:  explored basic descriptive statistics (max/min, mean or mode) for variables and used GROUP BY and ORDER BY to answer more complicated questions from executives (such where are the top 10 cities from within our top 10 countries, or which movie genres have both high numbers of rentals and bring in high gross sales, etc.)

•	**Coding with Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** designed CTEs that would make code more readable and easier to reuse. 

•	**Reporting results:** customized the form of the reports to fit the audience.  For example, executives received from me a PowerPoint with answers to key questions and a Tableau dashboard that would allow them to further explore the data.  In addition to having access to those reports, other analysts in the data department could access my data dictionary and documentation about queries (and the results of the queries) in an Excel workbook.
